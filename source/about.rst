About this website
******************

This website hosts learning materials for two courses taught at the University of Helsinki: *Working with Text in Python* and *Natural Language Processing for Linguists*. 

Together, these two courses provide an introduction to *applied language technology* for audiences who are unfamiliar with language technology and programming. The learning materials assume no previous knowledge of the Python programming language.

About these courses and their goals
===================================

Language technology (or natural language processing) studies how computers process and represent all kinds of natural languages, whether they are written or spoken. Language technology is now used in many real-world applications, which range from traditional tasks such as filtering e-mails for spam to complex communicative situations, such as providing customer service using chatbots.

As a part of this development, language technology has gradually become more accessible in recent years. Popular programming languages such as Python offer easy access to libraries that allow users to apply the latest language technology. To newcomers, however, programming languages such as Python may appear intimidating. 

For this reason, these courses are intended to serve as a gentle introduction to applying language technology using Python. The courses are designed particularly with language majors in mind and seek to empower them by making language technology accessible and its current limitations understandable.
