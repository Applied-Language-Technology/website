    "\n",
    "In natural language processing, gold standards are used to measure how well humans perform on some task.\n",

    "The goal of natural language processing is to allow computers to achieve or surpass human-level performance in some pre-defined task. \n",

    "Consider, for instance, placing words into word classes: word classes are not given to us by nature, but represent an abstraction that imposes structure on natural language.\n",
    "\n",
