    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a technique for learning numerical representations for individual words based on the context in which the words appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical representations are a prerequisite for computational processing, that is, performing mathematical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is rather long, because word embeddings are used for many natural language processing tasks, which can also inform linguistic research.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this section, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    " - understand the relation between the distributional hypothesis and word embeddings\n",
    " - how linguistic structures can be represented numerically\n",
    " - understand how word embeddings are learned"

    "## Background: a linguistic perspective on word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for word embeddings is often attributed to the following observation by the English linguist [J.R. Firth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rupert_Firth):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What Firth means is that the meaning of a word can be inferred by examining the word in its context of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Martin ([2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.2016.1141939): 45) notes that Firth's interest in co-occurrences of words, or *collocations*, has spawned a wealth of linguistic research, particularly in the field of corpus linguistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firth's observation also resonates with the so-called *distributional hypothesis* (Harris [1954](https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1954.11659520)), that is, linguistic items with similar distributions should have similar meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the distributional hypothesis from a linguistic perspective, Magnus Sahlgren ([2008](http://soda.swedish-ict.se/3941/1/sahlgren.distr-hypo.pdf): 33–34) points out that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Proponents of distributional methods often seem comfortable to ascribe meaning to distributional representations without explaining what they _mean_ by meaning. For the non-distributionalist, on the other hand, this will surely seem odd if not completely outrageous, since meaning is usually taken to involve both reference to objects and situations in the world outside language, and to concepts and ideas inside the mind of the language user.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sahlgren ([2008](http://soda.swedish-ict.se/3941/1/sahlgren.distr-hypo.pdf): 34) argues that the distributional hypothesis can be seen as having strong roots in \"structuralist soil\", that is, [Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure)'s ideas about the structure of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saussure described language as having two facets: *langue*, the abstract system constituted by language, and *parole*, that is, instances of language produced by the underlying system of *langue*. Saussure characterised *langue* as having _syntagmatic_ and _paradigmatic_ axes of organisation, which determine the relations that can hold between linguistic signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/parasyn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Saussure's and Firth's ideas were taken further by Firth's student [M.A.K. Halliday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Halliday), who incorporated them into the foundations of a theory of language known as [systemic functional linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_functional_linguistics) (for a recent overview, see Martin [2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.2016.1141939)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to Saussure's view of language as a static system, Halliday emphasised the role of _choice_ for language. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Halliday's view, language is defined by *meaning potential*, which is realised *dynamically* through choices made within linguistic systems. In other words, linguistic structures are the result of making constant choices between _paradigmatic alternatives_ and combining the result of these choices into _syntagmatic organisations_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Systemic functional linguistics also emphasises the contribution of _context_ to meaning. That is, the situation in which language is used and the purpose served by language use (see e.g. Fontaine [2017](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40554-017-0051-7)).\n",
    "\n",
    "With these points in mind, we will now turn to explore the distributional hypothesis from both syntagmatic and paradigmatic perspectives."
