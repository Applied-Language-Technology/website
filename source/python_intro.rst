Part I: A Minimal Introduction to Python
****************************************

Part I provides a minimal introduction to the Python programming language and Jupyter, the interactive environment used for creating these learning materials and interacting with Python.

Because these learning materials teach how to *apply* language technology, the following sections cover the bare minimum â€“ just enough to proceed to :doc:`Part II <working_with_text>`. You will learn more about Python and its capabilities going forward.
