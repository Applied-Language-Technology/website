An overview of the learning environments
========================================

This course uses several learning environments, which are directly accessible through your web browser.

`GitHub <https://www.github.com>`_ is a service for storing code, documentation and other materials. The learning materials and this website are hosted on GitHub.

`CSC Notebooks <https://notebooks.csc.fi>`_ is a cloud service provided by CSC â€“ IT Center for Science, a Finnish non-profit state enterprise. CSC Notebooks are used for running JupyterLab, which provides access to the interactive learning materials and the Python programming language. 

.. important::

   CSC Notebooks is only available to staff and students of Finnish institutions of higher education.

`Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ is a service that is similar to CSC Notebooks, but available to everyone. Binder also runs JupyterLab.

`TestMyCode <https://tmc.mooc.fi/>`_ is a programming assignment evaluator, which is currently developed by the Agile Education Research group at the University of Helsinki. TestMyCode is used to handle and automatically grade the exercises for this course.
