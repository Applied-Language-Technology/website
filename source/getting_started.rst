Introduction to the learning environments
=========================================

The courses use several learning environments accessible through your web browser:

1. **GitHub** and **GitHub Classroom**. The course materials and exercises are hosted on GitHub, a service for storing code, documentation and other materials. GitHub Classroom is used to manage the exercises.

2. **CSC Notebooks** is a service provided by CSC, a Finnish non-profit state enterprise that serves Finnish institutions of higher education. CSC Notebooks host the interactive learning materials, which are based on **Jupyter**.

The following diagram provides an overview of the environments and services used.
