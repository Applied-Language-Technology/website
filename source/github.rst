Retrieving learning materials from GitHub
=========================================

Click **Terminal** to access the command line interface.

Type the following command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

`git clone https://github.com/uh-eng-3041-2019/lectures.git`

GitHub will prompt you for your GitHub username and password.

Enter your information to proceed.

This will *clone* the lecture materials from GitHub. 

From now on, we can simply *pull* updates from the central repository on GitHub.

Use the menu on the left-hand side of JupyterLab to navigate to the directory `lectures/`.

Click the file `01_introduction.ipynb` to open this notebook.
