Working in JupyterLab
=====================

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive environment for programming, which runs on the server on CSC Notebooks, and is accessible through your web browser.

This course uses JupyterLab for interactive programming using Jupyter Notebooks, which can combine code, text, images and video.

We also use the Terminal, which provides a command line interface to the server.

The main view of JupyterLab has two major elements: *File Browser* (left) and *Launcher* (right).

The *File Browser* allows you to explore the files stored on the server, whereas the *Launcher* can be used to launch applications within JupyterLab.
